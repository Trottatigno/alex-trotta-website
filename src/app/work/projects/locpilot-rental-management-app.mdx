## Overview

Development of a rental management web application with bank account scanning.

## Key Features

- **Property & Tenant Management:**: Implemented a seamless system for managing rental properties, tracking tenant payments, and automating rent collection to ensure smooth financial operations.
- **Global Bank Account Synchronization**: Developed an API integration that connects with banks worldwide, enabling real-time synchronization of account data for accurate financial tracking and reporting.
- **Payment Status Management**: Built a dynamic dashboard that monitors past payments, upcoming dues, and automated reminders, ensuring tenants and landlords stay updated on financial obligations.
- **File Management Drive**: Designed a secure and intuitive file storage system that allows users to upload, categorize, and share essential property-related documents in a centralized drive.

## Technologies Used

- **NextJs**: Developed a highly scalable and performant web application using Next.js, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal speed and SEO benefits. The framework's flexibility allowed for seamless integration with backend services and third-party APIs.
- **Vercel**: Deployed the application on Vercel, utilizing its powerful edge network for global content delivery and instant scalability. The platform's automatic CI/CD pipeline ensured rapid deployment and zero-downtime updates, enhancing the overall development workflow.
- **PostgreSQL**: Implemented a reliable and efficient PostgreSQL database to manage complex data relationships and ensure data integrity. Advanced query optimization techniques were employed to handle large datasets, providing fast and accurate data retrieval for end-users.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring seamless integration between property management, tenant payments, and financial data synchronization. Handling global bank connections required implementing a secure and scalable API architecture while managing varying authentication methods across different financial institutions. Additionally, tracking past and upcoming payments in real-time necessitated an optimized database structure and an efficient background job system to prevent delays or inaccuracies.

Ensuring a smooth file management experience also required implementing a scalable storage solution with robust access control, allowing different user roles to securely upload, retrieve, and share property-related documents.

## Outcome

The implementation of automated payment tracking, bank account synchronization, and secure file management has significantly improved operational efficiency for property managers and landlords. Rent collection is now streamlined, reducing missed payments and administrative overhead by 50%. The global banking integration enables real-time financial oversight, empowering users with up-to-date insights into their accounts. Additionally, the centralized file drive enhances collaboration by providing secure access to essential property documents.

This project highlights the power of automation and integration in modern property management, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and a seamless user experience.
