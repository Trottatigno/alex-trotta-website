Onlyne App is an innovative platform designed to streamline large-file sharing, collaborative project management, and instant annotation of visual content. With an intuitive interface and real-time features, teams can seamlessly work on documents, images, and videos without technical barriers or feedback delays.

## Key Features

- **Secure File Transfer**: Implemented an optimized upload/download system with end-to-end encryption and automatic resume after interruptions, ensuring data integrity.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Integrated live annotations for instant communication, accompanied by live alerts and notifications on task progress and file updates. (Realtime database)
- **Multimedia Annotation**: Advanced annotation tools allow drawing, highlighting, and commenting directly on images and videos. Annotations are synchronized so every team member can see comments as they happen.
- **Version Control & History**: Automatic version tracking for each file, with the ability to revert to previous states, compare changes, and restore content based on timestamps.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Configurable approval pipelines (submission → review → approval) with automated notifications and reminders to meet deadlines and responsibilities.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Progressive Web App (PWA) and hybrid mobile apps (iOS/Android) ensure continuous access—even offline—with automatic synchronization upon reconnection.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js & Next.js**: For a highly responsive web interface, server-side rendering, and optimized SEO.
- **React Native & Capacitor**: To build hybrid mobile applications, delivering a native feel on both iOS and Android from a single codebase.
- **AWS S3 & B2 Backblaze**: For storing large files with a globally distributed CDN for fast, reliable delivery. (aws-sdk)
- **KonvaJs**: Enabling client-side image annotation, vector drawing, and image processing.
- **Video.js**: For adaptive video playback, advanced controls, and timecode-based annotation support.
- **Vercel**: For seamless deployment, global CDN distribution, serverless function support, and zero-configuration builds, ensuring fast, scalable hosting and continuous integration.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was delivering a smooth user experience when annotating high-resolution videos simultaneously. We needed to optimize video streaming and design a synchronization mechanism that minimized latency. By leveraging WebRTC for streaming and Socket.IO for event synchronization, we reduced annotation display delay to under 200 ms.

Another major hurdle was managing access rights and data protection. We designed a granular permissions system (view, edit, annotate, approve) and implemented server-side encryption as well as short-lived JWT tokens to secure every transaction. This experience deepened our expertise in secure architecture and GDPR compliance.

Implementing a visual diff history also required integrating change-detection algorithms for images and videos.

## Outcome

Onlyne App has transformed how teams handle multimedia content, cutting validation turnaround times from days to just hours. User feedback confirms a significant boost in productivity, enhanced traceability of changes, and stronger collaboration across cross-functional teams (designers, videographers, project managers). With rapid adoption internally and among external partners, centralizing communication, sharing, and file review within a secure, intuitive ecosystem.
