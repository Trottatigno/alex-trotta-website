## Overview

Foodswip is a modern food ordering and order management web application designed to streamline the entire process, from menu customization to real-time order tracking and fulfillment. Built with Next.js and Node.js/Express.js, Foodswip offers a seamless experience for both customers and restaurant managers, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Live ordering**: Enables customers to place orders in real-time with instant updates on their status, providing a smooth and interactive ordering experience.
- **Order manegement**: A robust dashboard for restaurant owners to manage incoming orders, track their status, and optimize workflow for faster processing.
- **Drag-and-drop menu personalization**: Restaurant owners can customize their menus with a simple drag-and-drop interface, making it easy to update offerings and manage item availability.
- **Live tracking**: Customers can track their orders in real-time, from preparation to delivery, ensuring transparency and enhanced user satisfaction.
- **Ticket printing**: Integrated support for ticket printing allows kitchens to receive direct order prints, improving efficiency and reducing errors.

## Technologies Used

- **NextJs**: Leveraged for its server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) to enhance performance and SEO, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Vercel**: Used for deployment, enabling fast and scalable hosting with automatic CI/CD pipelines for seamless updates.
- **ExpressJs**: Built a robust API backend to handle order processing, menu management, and real-time updates efficiently.
- **NodeJs**: Provides a high-performance runtime environment for handling concurrent requests and ensuring smooth data processing.
- **Capacitor**: Enables cross-platform functionality, allowing Foodswip to run as a progressive web app (PWA) and integrate with mobile devices seamlessly.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was implementing a real-time order tracking system that synchronizes seamlessly between customers and restaurants. Ensuring low-latency updates required optimizing WebSocket connections and database queries.

Additionally, creating an intuitive drag-and-drop menu builder involved refining the UI/UX to balance flexibility and ease of use. Restaurant managers needed a system that allowed for quick menu adjustments without complex configurations.

## Outcome

Foodswip has significantly enhanced order management efficiency for restaurants by reducing processing times and minimizing errors. Live tracking and automated ticket printing have improved customer satisfaction and kitchen workflow. The successful deployment on Vercel ensures high availability and fast global performance, making Foodswip a reliable solution for modern food businesses.

This project showcases the power of real-time data, intuitive UI design, and scalable web technologies in revolutionizing the food ordering experience.
