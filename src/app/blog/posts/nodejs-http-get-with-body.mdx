# How to Send GET Requests with a Body in Node.js

In HTTP standards, GET requests are **not supposed to have a body**. However, certain APIs break this convention â€” either by design or oversight. One such example is the [Mecaplanning API](https://www.3dsoft.fr/), which expects data to be sent in the body of a GET request.

This unusual requirement led me to build a small, specialized Node.js utility: [`nodejs-http-get-with-body`](https://github.com/Trottatigno/nodejs-http-get-with-body). It's a simple, robust solution to make such requests possible using Nodeâ€™s built-in `https` module.

## Why This Is Necessary

The majority of libraries and HTTP clients â€” like Axios or Fetch â€” **do not allow a body in GET requests**. They follow the standard, which discourages this pattern. But if you're working with a legacy or poorly designed API that mandates a body in GET, you have to go low-level.

Thatâ€™s exactly what this utility does: it bypasses high-level abstractions and uses Nodeâ€™s native `https.request()` to send custom headers and a JSON body â€” even with the `GET` method.

## Key Features of the Utility

1. **Pure Node.js (no external dependencies)**  
   The script relies solely on the native `https` module, making it lightweight and portable.

2. **Support for HTTPS GET with a body**  
   This is the main feature: you can send a request body with a `GET` request â€” something other libraries typically block.

3. **Easy-to-use helper function**  
   Just import the utility, pass in your URL, headers, and body â€” and youâ€™re good to go.

## How It Works

The utility uses Nodeâ€™s `https.request()` method, where you can manually set:

- Method: `'GET'`
- Headers: including `Content-Type` and `Content-Length`
- Request body: passed in as a JSON string

Hereâ€™s a quick example:

```javascript
const { getWithBody } = require("./getWithBody");

const url = "https://example.com/api/data";
const body = { userId: "123", filter: "recent" };
const headers = { "Content-Type": "application/json" };

getWithBody(url, headers, body)
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

This script will send a GET request with a body, just like the Mecaplanning API expects.

## When Should You Use This?

Only when absolutely necessary.

GET requests with a body are not recommended, and not supported by many intermediaries like proxies and caches. But if you must deal with an API thatâ€™s built this way, this tool can save you hours of frustration.

Use this only in cases where:

- The API youâ€™re calling explicitly requires a body in a GET request
- You canâ€™t modify the API behavior
- No other HTTP method (like POST) is accepted

## GitHub Repository

You can find the complete utility, along with documentation and examples, on GitHub:

Feel free to fork it, star it, or contribute improvements!

## Conclusion

While not standard, GET requests with a body are sometimes unavoidable. With the right tools â€” like the one Iâ€™ve created â€” you can still work effectively with these edge-case APIs.

If you've ever been stuck debugging why your GET request isn't working even though "the body is correct" â€” this is likely the missing piece.
